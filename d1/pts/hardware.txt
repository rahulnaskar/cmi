Digital computers work on binary mathematics. Which when done with electrical machines, electronic machines relates to voltages. Where presence of a voltage (+ 5v) means 1 absence of it (+1 v) implies 0.
The computer can work with two states ON and OFF. ON state is represented by 1 and OFF state is represented by 0. This system of using 1 and 0 is called as the Binary system.

The computer uses three types memory the RAM ROM and Cache.
